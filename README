NAME
    Geo::Address::Mail::Standardizer - A role for Geo::Address::Mail
    standardization

SYNOPSIS
    This module provides an interface for writing address standardization as
    well as a class to represent the results of a standarization process.

        package Geo::Address::Mail::Standardizer::My;
        use Moose;

        with 'Geo::Address::Mail::Standardizer';

        # use it

        my $std = Geo::Address::Mail::Standardizer::My->new(...);
        my $address = Geo::Address::Mail::MyCountry;
        my $results = $std->standardize($address);

WRITING A STANDARDIZER
    This module provides a simple API. Your Standardizer implementation is
    likely for a specific locale such as the US, UK or whatever. You should
    provide a "standardize" method that accepts the appropriate subclass
    (Geo::Address::Mail::YourCountry). You would then use the information in
    the supplied address object with your standardization mechanism. You
    should not change the argument. Instead, create a new Address object and
    use it with the Geo::Address::Mail::Standardizer::Results object,
    setting any changed values:

      sub standardize {
          my ($self, $address) = @_;

          # contact the USPS or your local postal service in your country
          # or implement some algorithm or whatever

          my $results = Geo::Address::Mail::Standardizer::Results->new;
          my $new_addr = $address->clone;
          for(...) { # iterate over the results of your standardization mechanism
            $results->set_changed($field, $new_value) if $changed;
            $new_addr->$field($new_value);
          }

          return $results;
      }
